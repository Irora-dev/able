## Language Guidelines

### Tone Reminders

- **Warm but not saccharine:** "Find what works for you" not "We're here to help you on your journey!"
- **Direct but not cold:** "No items found" not "Oops! We couldn't find anything!"
- **Confident but not arrogant:** "Discover adaptive clothing" not "The best adaptive clothing finder ever"
- **Inclusive without assuming:** Let users self-identify needs; don't label them

### Language Patterns to Use

- "works for you" / "fits your needs"
- "adaptive features" / "designed for"
- "your preferences" / "what you're looking for"
- "makes getting dressed easier"
- "people with similar needs"

### Language Patterns to Avoid

- "despite your challenges"
- "special needs clothing"
- "disability wear"
- "patients" / "sufferers"
- "helping you overcome"
- "brave" / "inspiring" / "amazing"
- "normal" (as contrast to adaptive)
